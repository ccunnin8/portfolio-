        <h3>Pharmacist-in-Charge</h3>
        <h3>July 2015-Present</h3>
        <p>As a pharmacy manager of a busy neighborhood store in Washington, DC I oversee the daily operations of the pharmacy, while providing pharmaceutical care to the people of Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Since becoming manager our script volume has increased steadily. This past flu season we had a succsessful vaccination campaign that nearly exceeded our corporate projects.</p>
        <p>We have optimized our workflow to become more efficient, we have decreased the amount of unused inventory, and we have increased our overall customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p>As staff pharmacist at a new store in the Navy Yard section of Capitol Hill Washington, DC, I was able to work with my team to provide excellent customer service, reflected through our "My Customer Impact" scores.

        <h3>Pharmacy Intern</h3>
        <h3>August 2011 - May 2015 </h3>
        <p>As an intern at CVS pharmacy I learned how to provide exxcellent customer service by finding solutions to problems. For example, if a patient was upset about their copay: I learned to investigate the whys of what was causing it. Was it a deductible? Not covered? Tier 4. Many times, I would find ways to reduce copays, for instance: finding a discoutn card online for a brand name only item.</p>
